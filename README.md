 EndlessRunner
This is the ReadMe file for A Endless Runner game done as an assignment for a school course in c++ and unreal engine. My aim was to get a deeper understanding of the engine as a whole and c++ and a langauge.  
Through the process of the project I aimed to challange myself to learn things such as Timelines and so on even though there were easier routes.
